              <p className="text-sm leading-sm">
                Photobiomodulation, also known as low-level light therapy, is a
                groundbreaking technology that leverages specific wavelengths of
                light to stimulate cellular activity and promote healing. It’s a
                non-invasive method that's been scientifically proven to combat
                the natural decline of collagen production that begins around
                the age of 25. By energizing the cells and enhancing their
                regenerative capabilities, this technique can effectively
                reverse signs of aging, improve skin texture, and increase
                overall skin health. With continued use, photobiomodulation can
                lead to a visibly firmer, more youthful complexion.
